            summary: Modifies the status, as well as the manifest of a package.
            description: |
                The **amend** operation modifies the status of a Package. The new status of the package must be either the same as the current status or an allowed status transition. For example, a Package ID under the status `STANDBY` may only be advanced to either `STANDBY` (modify package manifest only), or `REVIEW_STAGING`. Attempting to advance a package to an invalid status will result in an error.

                Package manifest modifications may be made by providing an `amendments` object in the request body. This object will be merged with the existing manifest. If a field in the `amendments` object conflicts with an existing field in the manifest, the field in the `amendments` object will take precedence. Fields that are invalid or not allowed to be modified (under the current package status) will be ignored and returned in the response.

                A new version (and a new version ID) will be created every time this operation is performed. The version ID will be returned in the response. The old version with the content of the manifest prior to modification will be stored.

                You must be the owner of the package to modify the package.

                **Requests to this endpoint is limited to 1 per 2 hours, per account. In urgent cases where immediate modification is required, contact the Tomlyn team.**

                The **COMM Token** associated with this account. A repository may choose to use this token to verify the identity of the requestor. COMM Tokens are valid for 24 hours.

                This authentication method is optional - the repository can choose whether to honor this token or not. It is up to the repository to decide when this token is required as well as what resources this token can authorize access to.

                In addition, individual repository implementations may impose their own authentication methods, which may include passing in a token provided by that repository in the `Authorization` header.
